# OpenAL_CocosAudio_RepeatTest

This case is an example of repeated audio.

Audio Engine provided by [cocos](https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine), Audio library provided by [Apple-OpenAL](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/OpenAL/tree/OpenAL-68). Public Utility comes from [2601](https://github.com/zrnsm/2601) as right now public utility is abandoned by apple.

When the program runs, it will trigger an assert caused by `assert(mState == AL_PLAYING)`.
